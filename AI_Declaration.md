## AI Usage Declaration

### What i used ai for

- I used Chatgpt to draft the deployment steps for Vite + GitHub Pages.
- Used Chatgpt to iterate on UI polish options and to produce small css snippets.
- Used Chatgpt to provide some snippets of simple, initial version for some of the components(search bar, hooks).


### What i did myself

- Component architecture and wiring
- Decided which data points to fetch (temperature, precipitation, conditions)
- Implemented geocoding for city search (convert city name to coordinates)
- Transformed API response to match my component needs
- Testing the app (Various cities, different browsers, test responsiveness)

### What i learned from this project

- AI is great for boilerplate and standard patterns, but UX decisions and debugging still requires human judgment.
- AI is good for syntax help and standard implementations, but for architecture decisions still need human input.
- Learning Geocoding API, Understanding how to convert city names to coordinates and handle data selections.

### All in all

For me, AI accelerates the "known problems" for example, how to debounce, how to fetch, so I could spend more time on the "interesting problems" like, what's the best UX and how to handle edge cases. This is how I want to use AI professionally,  as a tool that handles boilerplate so I can focus on creative problem-solving and user experience.
